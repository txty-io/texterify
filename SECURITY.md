# Security Policy

This document details how security issues are handled and what you can do if you find a security issue.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Found a security issue? Please **don't** create an issue on GitHub. Instead send an email with your findings to security@texterify.com. After a fixed version was released we will publicly disclose the issue.

We can't guarantee a prompt human response but if it takes more than a day to get an answer check if the email you sent us has really been sent. Also contact us by other means to check if the message was correctly received and acknowledged.
